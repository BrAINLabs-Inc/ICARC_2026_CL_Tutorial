# **Curriculum Learning: An Efficient Learning Paradigm**

This repository contains materials used for the **International Conference on Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC-2026)** Tutorial Session on **Curriculum Learning: An Efficient Learning Paradigm**.

## 📖 About

Curriculum Learning (CL) is a training strategy inspired by how humans learn—starting from easier concepts and gradually progressing to more complex ones. By organizing training data in a meaningful order, CL enables machine learning models to converge faster, achieve better generalization, and improve overall performance. This tutorial explores the fundamentals of curriculum learning, its key strategies, and practical applications in deep learning.
